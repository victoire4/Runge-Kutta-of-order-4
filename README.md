# Runge-Kutta-of-order-4
Runge Kutta is a numerical method used to solved Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) of higher order. It has a better approximation than the Euler method. Runge Kutta method can only be applied on first order ODE.
Therefore, this code help to find the solution of ODE. second order using Runge Kutta.
